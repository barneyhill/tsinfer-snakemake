	This directory contains a build of the Hg38 genetic map.

    The map was generated automatically by lifting over HapMapII_GRCh37 to Hg38             using `liftOver_assemblies.py` in stdpopsim.
    The chain file `hg19ToHg38.over.chain.gz` was downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser             and the UCSC liftOver tool was used to perform the lift.

    The following command was used:

    ../../../../../stdpopsim/maintenance/liftOver_catalog.py --species HomSap --map HapMapII_GRCh37 --chainFile ../../chainfiles/hg19ToHg38.over.chain.gz --validationChain ../../chainfiles/hg38ToHg19.over.chain.gz --winLen 1000 --useAdjacentAvg --retainIntermediates --gapThresh 1000000
